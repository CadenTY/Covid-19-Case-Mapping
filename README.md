# Lab-3-Geospatial-Data-Mapping
Curated by Caden Henson

This Lab Assignment had us create two different maps in order to visualize Covid-19 cases counts and rates within the United States. One map was a proportional symbols map which plotted out the count of cases and the other was a choropleth map that plotted out the rate of Covid-19 per county. 

The COVID-19 case/death data that was used was gathered from The New York Times. The data includes all the cases in 2020. The population data used for calculating the case rates are from the 2018 ACS 5 year estimates. Both data are at the county level. The U.S. county boundary shapefile was downloaded from the U.S. Census Bureau. The case rate is calculated as cases per thousand residents.
